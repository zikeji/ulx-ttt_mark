# ULX ttt_mark

Small ULX utility to add a "!mark" or "ulx mark" command that functions similar to ttt_radio, except will mark the target as specified without needing to mark them on the scoreboard by finding and clicking the name.

## Installation

Install as you would a normal ULX addon, or install from the Workshop here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=899130656

## Usage

The command is available to all players. If no target is specified, will mark the person the player is looking at, if valid.
